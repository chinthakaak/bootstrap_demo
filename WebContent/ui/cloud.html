				<p>Strategy is important because the resources available to
					achieve these goals are usually limited. Strategy generally
					involves setting goals, determining actions to achieve the goals,
					and mobilizing resources to execute the actions. A strategy
					describes how the ends (goals) will be achieved by the means
					(resources).</p>

				<p>The order in which real or complex numbers are multiplied has
					no bearing on the product; this is known as the commutative law of
					multiplication. When matrices or members of various other
					associative algebras are multiplied, the product usually depends on
					the order of the factors. Matrix multiplication, for example, and
					multiplication in other algebras is in general non-commutative.</p>

				<h4 id="solitions">Our Solutions</h4>
				<p>In chemistry, a solution is a homogeneous mixture composed of
					two or more substances. In such a mixture, a solute is a substance
					dissolved in another substance, known as a solvent. The mixing
					process of a solution happens at a scale where the effects of
					chemical polarity are involved, resulting in interactions that are
					specific to solvation. The solution assumes the phase of the
					solvent when the solvent is the larger fraction of the mixture, as
					is commonly the case. The concentration of a solute in a solution
					is the mass of that solute expressed as a percentage of the mass of
					the whole solution.</p>

					military term compaignie (first recorded in 1150), meaning a "body
					of soldiers",[1] and originally from the Late Latin word companio
